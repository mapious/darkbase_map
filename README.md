The idea behind the darkbase map design was to simplify the map, on a lot of the example maps it seemed that the borders of the forests and parks had a tendency to complicate and muck up the look of the map. In my map I removed them to simplify the look of the map. I also standardized the text fonts of all labels as their disunity bothered me. Overall I changed the colors of the base and the ocean to be much darker than the original map mostly based on personal preferences.
