<b>Dark Base Map</b>


Link to map: https://sullivja.github.io/darkbase_map/


The idea behind the darkbase map design was to simplify the entire map, on a lot of the example maps it seemed that the borders of the forests and parks had a tendency to complicate and muck up the look of the map. In my map I removed them to simplify the look of the map. I also standardized the text fonts of all labels as their disunity bothered me. Overall I changed the colors of the base and the ocean to be much darker than the original map mostly based on personal preferences. I was going for a chalk board look with white chalk on a green board. Unfortunately due to the limits of the amount files that can be commited I did not include the icon folder which I didn't really use anyway.
